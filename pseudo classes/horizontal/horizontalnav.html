		<h2>Asahi 1900</h2>
		<p> A pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s.
		As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the ship was designed and 
		built in the United Kingdom. Shortly after her arrival in Japan, she became flagship of the 
		Standing Fleet, the IJN's primary combat fleet. She participated in every major naval battle of 
		the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and 
		the Battle of Tsushima. </p>
